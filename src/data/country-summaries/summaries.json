This fragile state functions less as a unified nation and more as a reluctant holding company for two distinct entities: the Bosniak-Croat Federation and the Serb-dominated Republika Srpska. Internal paralysis invites intense external meddling. While political leaders in Sarajevo push hard for full membership in the European Union—achieving candidate status in 2022—their ambition hits a wall of obstruction from Banja Luka. Milorad Dodik, the assertive leader of the Serb entity, frequently threatens secession and cultivates a warm friendship with President Putin to counter Western pressure. This internal fracture makes the country a playground for great power competition. The United States and Germany work to preserve the state's integrity through the Office of the High Representative, while Russia utilizes its historic Orthodox connections to spoil NATO expansion in the Balkans. Meanwhile, Turkey quietly exerts soft power through cultural restoration and investment, positioning itself as a protector of the Bosniak population without alienating its regional trade partners.",

Since the dramatic 2017 exit of Yahya Jammeh—an autocrat who ruled with an iron fist for two decades—President Adama Barrow has labored to convince the world that the country is open for business. Rejoining the Commonwealth marked a definitive pivot back toward the West and traditional development partners like the United Kingdom. However, the relationship with Senegal defines everyday existence here; Dakar’s troops were instrumental in securing the democratic transition and remain vital for security, even if this deep dependence occasionally sparks sovereignty concerns among locals. Recently, the administration has courted investment from Turkey and China to overhaul crumbling infrastructure, a push highlighted by hosting the Organization of Islamic Cooperation summit in 2024. Yet, the ghost of the past lingers. As the Truth, Reconciliation and Reparations Commission airs the atrocities of the Jammeh era, including state-sponsored murder, the current administration faces the delicate task of delivering justice without fracturing a fragile peace. It serves as a precarious test case for democratic resilience in a region increasingly prone to coups.",

President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, known as MBZ, drives a foreign policy defined by aggressive hedging. While the United States remains a primary security guarantor, the Emiratis increasingly refuse to pick sides in great power competition, welcoming Beijing for trade and technology while diversifying arms purchases with French Rafale jets. This drive for autonomy led to the 2020 Abraham Accords, normalizing ties with Israel not just for diplomatic prestige, but to create a high-tech security bulwark against Iran. Yet, even as they eye Tehran warily across the Gulf, Emirati officials maintain open diplomatic channels to ensure their gleaming skyscrapers remain safe from regional flare-ups. The federation projects power far beyond its borders, from established logistical chains in the Horn of Africa to active intervention in Libya, often prioritizing authoritarian stability over democracy. Ultimately, the United Arab Emirates views itself as a connector between East and West, willing to work with anyone—from Vladimir Putin to Narendra Modi—to secure a prosperous post-oil future.",

Nowhere is this clearer than in Ukraine, where British leadership in supplying advanced weaponry often prompts hesitant allies to follow suit. A pivot toward the Indo-Pacific, marked by the AUKUS submarine pact with the United States and Australia, reveals a deep anxiety about Chinese influence.
